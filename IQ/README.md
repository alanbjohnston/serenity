These are IQ files of Serenity

They aren't audio files - you can't just listen to them.

You need to play them in an SDR app such as SDR# or HDSDR

You can then tune them at 437.1 MHz FM 24kHz and you will hear the 4k8 signal.

If the SDR output is to an input, you can decodee them with Direwolf or Soundmodem.
